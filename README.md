# Araye.Code

This is .NET version of common codes we use in our web projects at [Araye](http://araye.net), it's based on codes from our employees or articles/open source projects in web. If you want to use this library in .NET Core you can take a look at [this repo](https://github.com/araye/Araye.Code.Core) which is port of this code using .NET Standard and still not released

**Important Note:** Due to heavy refactoring and changes in code v1.0.0 is not backward compatible
